Project Title: Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model
Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn, i.e., stop using the bank's services. By leveraging historical customer data, this model will help the bank proactively engage with customers at risk of leaving, thereby improving customer retention rates. The project covers several key machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

Key Components
Data Encoding:

Customer data often contains both numerical and categorical features. To prepare the data for machine learning models, it's essential to convert categorical variables into a numerical format. This project will demonstrate different encoding techniques such as One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding. These methods will be applied to transform categorical data (e.g., customer geography, gender) into a format suitable for input into the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
Feature Scaling:

Feature scaling is crucial for distance-based algorithms like SVM to ensure that all features contribute equally to the result. The project will cover standard techniques such as Standardization (using z-score) and Normalization (scaling features to a range, typically 0 to 1). This process ensures that the model does not give undue importance to features with larger numerical values.
Handling Imbalanced Data:

Customer churn datasets are often imbalanced, with a minority of customers actually churning. To address this, techniques like Random Under-Sampling, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), and class weighting in SVM will be explored. These methods will help in balancing the dataset, which is critical for building a robust predictive model.
Support Vector Machine Classifier:

SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, an SVM classifier will be used to predict customer churn. The choice of kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF) and the concept of hyperplanes and support vectors will be explained. The SVM classifier will be implemented using popular libraries like Scikit-Learn.
Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning:

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in optimizing model performance. This project will implement Grid Search to systematically work through multiple combinations of hyperparameters to determine the best model configuration. By evaluating different settings, including kernel type, regularization parameter (C), and gamma, the project will illustrate how to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of the SVM classifier.

Model Evaluation:

Test the model on unseen data to check its ability to generalize.
Analyze results and make recommendations based on the findings.
Conclusion
